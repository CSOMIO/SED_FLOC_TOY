SED_FLOC_TOY01
Set up for CSOMIO model runs

Notes about this model run:
o  One-dimensional, vertical version of COAWST.
o  Used Version COAWST Release from July 9, 2018.
o  Vertical grid: 
   50m deep
   30 evenly spaced grid cells.
   dz = 1.6667 m.
   Horizontal grid: 6x6 Uniform.
o  Forcing:   
   Temperature and salinity strongly nudged to measured values.
   Winds are input, but don’t seem to force the flow.
   Current velocities vary from about +- 20 cm/s.
   Waves are “on” but too small to matter for bed stress.  They are
   held constant in time. 
o  Sediment input:
   Includes 15 cohesive floc sizes, and 4 non-cohesive sand sizes.
   No external sources of sediment aside from bed resuspension.
   Shear stresses are not strong enough to suspend them.

o  Put the source code under the CSOMIO Git-Hub repository under
   “COAWST”.  This is a straight fork from John Warner’s latest version
   (July 9, 2018). 

o  Put the model implementation files under the CSOMIO Git-Hub
   repository under “SED_FLOC_TOY/SED_FLOC_TOY01”. This includes the
   -  input and configuration files (under External and Internal),  
      the build script (coawst.bash)
   -  model log file and output (*.out and Results History File).


Notes July 12:  Next steps with this model run seem to be 
o  adding sediment.  I think this could be done by nudging the
   sediment concentrations to a climatological value? or by have a
   source of sediment at the top of the water column? 
o  another thing that might be good to do is to stabilize the
   currents. Right now, I think that they are initialized and then
   impacted by the wind forcing.  The run that initializes them from
   rest seems to do better.  But, it might be nice to nudge the
   currents to some value that we want.
