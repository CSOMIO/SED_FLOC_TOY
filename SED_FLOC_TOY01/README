SED_FLOC_TOY01
Set up for CSOMIO model runs

Notes about this model run:
o  One-dimensional, vertical version of COAWST.
o  Used Version COAWST Release from July 9, 2018.
o  Vertical grid: 
   50m deep
   30 evenly spaced grid cells.
   dz = 1.6667 m.
   Horizontal grid: 6x6 Uniform.
o  Forcing:   
   Temperature and salinity strongly nudged to measured values.
   Winds are input, but don’t seem to force the flow.
   Current velocities vary from about +- 20 cm/s.
   Waves are “on” but too small to matter for bed stress.  They are
   held constant in time. 
o  Sediment input:
   Includes 15 cohesive floc sizes, and 4 non-cohesive sand sizes.
   No external sources of sediment aside from bed resuspension.
   Shear stresses are not strong enough to suspend them.

o  Put the source code under the CSOMIO Git-Hub repository under
   “COAWST”.  This is a straight fork from John Warner’s latest version
   (July 9, 2018). 

o  Put the model implementation files under the CSOMIO Git-Hub
   repository under “SED_FLOC_TOY/SED_FLOC_TOY01”. This includes the
   -  input and configuration files (under External and Internal),  
      the build script (coawst.bash)
   -  model log file and output (*.out and Results History File).
