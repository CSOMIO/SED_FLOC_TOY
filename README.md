# SED_FLOC_TOY
ROMS 1-D model implementation that includes sediment resuspension and flocculation processes. Based on the COAWST version of ROMS.  

Created by Courtney Harris, June 2018

SED_FLOC_TOY01: 1-D vertical model run with 15 floc size classes. 50-m
                water depth, and some wind and wave forcing. I don't
                think that there was any sediment actually suspended
                in this run (energy was too low).  

SED_FLOC_TOY02: Added sediment in the four finest size classes at the
		top of the water column. Changed the vertical
		resolution so that it has higher resolution near the
		seabed.
